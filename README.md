# RPG
This is an attempt to explain the Model View Controller (Compound Pattern) 
by building an RPG with three design patterns. Strategy, Composite and Observer.

## About Design Patterns
They are something to be used suggestively throughout your code. You do not
program to the implementation of a pattern but instead use them to communicate
ideas and solve problems in a more organically intuitive way.

When you look through the example code you will see extreme uses of Design
Patterns in order to to drive home an idea of what they are. There are 
parts of the code where simple good OO design would solve it. This is because
you should only apply patterns when and where they make sense. Consider the
implementation of this project to be forced and artificial.
